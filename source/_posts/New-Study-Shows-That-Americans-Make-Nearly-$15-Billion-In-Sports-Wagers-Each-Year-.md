#  New Study Shows That Americans Make Nearly $15 Billion In Sports Wagers Each Year 

According to a new study, Americans make nearly $15 billion in sports wagers each year. The study, conducted by the University of Las Vegas, also found that Nevada is responsible for more than 90% of that amount.

The findings are not all that surprising, as gambling has become increasingly popular in the United States in recent years. In fact, the American Gaming Association estimates that Americans bet more than $140 billion on sports each year.

Nevada has long been considered the gambling capital of the United States, and it has been legal to bet on sports there since 1931. The state offers a number of legal betting options, including wagers on individual games, futures bets (such as who will win the Super Bowl), and parlay bets (a combination of two or more bets).

Other states have begun to legalize sports betting in recent years, with New Jersey leading the charge. In 2012, New Jersey voters approved a referendum allowing casinos in Atlantic City to offer sports betting. The following year, the state legislature passed a law legalizing sports betting at racetracks and online casinos.

The Supreme Court struck down a federal law banning sports betting last year, opening the door for other states to legalize it. Since then, several states have moved to do so, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Arkansas.

It remains to be seen whether sports betting will become as popular in other states as it is in Nevada. But with billions of dollars at stake each year, it is sure to be a topic of discussion in state legislatures across the country.

#  Americans Gamble More Than $100 Million A Day On Sports, Study Says 

Americans love gambling, and that love extends to sports. A new study shows that Americans gamble more than $100 million every day on sports.

That’s a lot of money! And it’s no wonder that the sports betting industry is so lucrative. In fact, it’s estimated to be worth more than $7 billion annually.

So where does all this money come from? Well, not everyone bets big bucks. The average bet is just $9. But when you add up all the bets, that equates to more than $100 million a day.

Why do we gamble on sports? Some people do it for the excitement or the thrill of winning. Others are hoping to make some easy money. And some people just enjoy watching games and trying to predict the outcome.

No matter why people bet on sports, there’s no doubt that it’s a popular pastime. And with so much money at stake, it’s sure to remain a controversial topic as well.

Nevada Gambling Casinos Take In Over $4 Billion In Sports Wagers Annually

LAS VEGAS, NV - Despite being legal in only a handful of states, sports betting generates over $4 billion in revenue for Nevada casinos every year. That's more than double the take from table games like blackjack and roulette.

Casino executives say the widespread popularity of sports betting is due to the number of ways you can bet on a game. You can bet on the outcome, the margin of victory, or how many points will be scored. And with so many people interested in sports, there's always a game to bet on.

"We have more than 350 different sporting events that we offer odds on every single day," said Alan Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Resorts. "So there's something for everyone."

Casinos are even getting into the business of taking bets on eSports, which is professional video gaming. That's a rapidly growing market that is expected to generate over $700 million in bets this year.

The success of sports betting has sparked a debate about whether it should be legalized nationwide. Proponents argue that it would bring much-needed tax revenue to state governments, while opponents argue that it would lead to an increase in gambling addiction problems.

For now, the future of sports betting remains uncertain. But one thing is clear: Nevada casinos are reaping the benefits of being one of the few states where it's legal.

#  Delaware Sports Betting Totals Nearly $2 Billion In First Full Year 

Delaware sports betting totals nearly $2 billion in first full year.

Governor John Carney spoke at a news conference this week, revealing that in the state’s first full year of legalized sports betting, $1.9 billion was wagered. Carney says the state collected $11 million in taxes from sports betting in the fiscal year that ended on June 30th.

The Delaware Lottery operates four casinos that offer sports betting, as well as several off-track betting parlors. Bettors can place wagers on NFL games, college football, NBA games, and other professional and amateur sporting events.

In neighboring New Jersey, lawmakers are anticipating that sports betting will bring in up to $1 billion in tax revenue annually. That state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement released its fiscal year-end numbers for July through December 2018 this week; during that time period, New Jersey took in nearly $385 million in bets on sporting events. The state’s 12% tax on those bets generated over $47 million in revenue. 

Pennsylvania also offers legal sports betting, with tax revenue coming in slightly below Delaware’s take so far. Through the end of May 2019, the Keystone State has taken in just over $103 million in taxes from sports betting operations. 

It will be interesting to see how the numbers shake out over time, as more states come online with this form of gambling. In the meantime, it looks like Delaware is reaping the rewards of being one of the earlier adopters of legalized sports betting.

#  New Jersey Takes In Over $1.1 Billion In Sports Wagers In First Six Months

A report by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement released on Monday shows that the state took in more than $1.1 billion in sports bets in the first six months of this year.

This was more than double the amount taken in during the same period last year, and is a strong indication that sports betting is becoming increasingly popular in New Jersey.

The report also showed that nearly $260 million was wagered on NFL games alone in the first half of 2018, making it by far the most popular sport for betting in New Jersey.

This trend is likely to continue as the NFL season progresses, with many bettors looking to take advantage of favourable odds on their favoured teams.

In addition to NFL games, a wide range of other sporting events were wagered on during the first half of 2018, including major league baseball, college football, and international soccer matches.
