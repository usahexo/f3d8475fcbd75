#  So What casino leads the way with new payment method!



Casino is now one of the first to offer a brand new payment method that is shaking up the industry. The company has announced that it will start accepting Bitcoin, the leading digital currency, as a payment option. 

Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular as it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It is also a very secure form of payment as every transaction is recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain. This makes it difficult for criminals to use Bitcoin for illegal activities. 

Bitcoin can be used to purchase goods and services online and can also be converted into traditional currency. Casino CEO, Matti Sarvamaa, said: "We are always looking for new and innovative ways to offer our players the best possible gaming experience." 

"The decision to start accepting Bitcoin was made after careful consideration and we believe that it will be beneficial for both our players and our company." 

Other casinos are expected to follow suit and begin accepting Bitcoin in the near future.
