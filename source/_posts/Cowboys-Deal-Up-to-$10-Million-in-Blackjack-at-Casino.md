#  Cowboys Deal Up to $10 Million in Blackjack at Casino

The Dallas Cowboys were in Las Vegas this weekend and they decided to blow some money at the casino. Specifically, they were playing blackjack and they dealt up to $10 million worth of hands.

Obviously, that's a lot of money and it's clear that the Cowboys were feeling lucky. They managed to win a lot of money as well, so it was clearly a good decision on their part.

Obviously, this isn't something that the Cowboys are going to do on a regular basis. But it does show that they're not afraid to take risks when it comes to gambling. And that's sure to excite fans who are looking for an exciting team to root for.

The Cowboys have had a bit of a disappointing season so far. But with moves like this, it's clear that they're still willing to take risks and try to shake things up. If they can start winning some games, then this will surely be seen as a turning point in their season.

#  Cowboys Deal 21 at Casino in Vegas

A group of six Cowboys fans were in town for the week leading up to the big game against the Raiders. They had all arrived on Sunday and by Monday night, they were feeling lucky. So, they headed down to the casino at the New York-New York hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.

After a few hours of gambling, the group was up 21 – not a bad start! But then things started to go downhill. In the span of just a few minutes, they lost all of their winnings and more.

“I can’t believe it,” said one of the guys in the group. “We were doing so well and then we just blew it all.”

But they weren’t deterred – they decided to keep gambling. And eventually, they did start winning back some money.

In the end, though, they all ended up losing money overall. But that didn’t stop them from having a good time – they still managed to enjoy their time in Las Vegas despite their losses at the casino.

#  Cowboys Deal $5M Worth of Blackjack at Casino 

ARLINGTON, TX - The Dallas Cowboys were seen gambling earlier this week at the Winstar Casino in Oklahoma. Reportedly, the Cowboys dealt $5 million worth of blackjack and lost the majority of it. 

According to a witness, wide receiver Dez Bryant was "all in" on several hands, while quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott looked on. Bryant lost over $1 million, while Prescott and Elliott each lost around $100,000. 

It's not clear why the Cowboys decided to gamble so much money, but it's certainly an expensive lesson. Hopefully they can recover and get back to winning football games.

#  Dallas Cowboys Deal Nearly $1M in Blackjack Over Weekend 

In what is being called the "biggest wager in casino history," the Dallas Cowboys nearly gambled away $1 million this past weekend. Reportedly, the NFL team was playing blackjack at the Wynn resort in Las Vegas when they lost almost half of their total bankroll. 

The Cowboys were not alone in their weekend betting spree; other high-profile individuals, including rapper Jay-Z and basketball player LeBron James, were also spotted at the casino tables. A spokesperson for the Wynn Resort commented on the weekend's events, saying "We had a lot of very high rollers here this weekend." 

While it is unclear how much money the Cowboys actually lost, reports say that they came close to burning through their entire $2 million budget. This incident is just the latest in a long line of sports teams and athletes who have become known for their lavish and reckless gambling habits. 

Just last year, NBA referee Tim Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months in prison after admitting to betting on games he officiated. And in 2007, Detroit Tigers pitcher Kenny Rogers was fined and suspended for 20 games after being caught throwing a game in exchange for future gambling profits. 

So why do professional athletes seem to be so drawn to gambling? For many of them, it's likely a combination of easy access to money and a feeling of invincibility that comes with being a celebrity. And while most players are smart enough not to bet on games they are directly involved in, there is always the risk that one bad decision could end up ruining someone's career. 

For now, it appears that the Dallas Cowboys have survived their ill-fated trip to Las Vegas. But as with all things gambling-related, there is always the potential for disaster.

#  Cowboys Deal More Than $1 Million in Blackjack During Training Camp

The Dallas Cowboys are one of the most popular teams in the NFL, and they proved that their fans are just as enthusiastic off the field this year. Reports from training camp say that the team has dealt more than $1 million in blackjack during the first week.

It’s not unusual for NFL teams to have prop bets or games going on during training camp, but the Cowboys have taken things to a new level. The team’s official Twitter account even tweeted out a photo of some of the players taking a break from practice to enjoy a game of blackjack.

Cowboys fans are no doubt hoping that this good luck continues into the regular season. The team is looking to build on its success from last year, when they made it all the way to the playoffs before losing to the Green Bay Packers.
