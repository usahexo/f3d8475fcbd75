#  FFXIV: How To Get Larger Than Level 16 Duty Roulette In Peru

If you're like most people, you want to get the most out of your Final Fantasy XIV experience. You want to level up as quickly as possible, and get loot that will help you on your way. However, there are some activities that are better than others when it comes to leveling up and gaining new gear. One of the best activities to participate in is the Duty Roulette. This is a type of game that pits players against difficult challenges and gives them great rewards for completing them. However, if you're stuck at level 16 or below, you may not be able to access some of the more difficult Duty Roulettes.Thankfully, there is a way to get around this obstacle. In Peru, there is a location called the Tomb of King Midas that will increase your level cap by 4 levels, allowing you to participate in more challenging Duty Roulettes. To get there, follow these simple steps:

1) Go to the entrance of The Great Gubal Library in Eastern Thanalan

2) Head north until you reach a bridge

3) Cross the bridge and head east until you find a small path that leads up a hill

4) Follow the path until you reach the Tomb of King Midas

Once you're at the Tomb of King Midas, speak with Jalzahn and he will raise your level cap by 4 levels. This will allow you to participate in more difficult versions of the Duty Roulette, giving you an edge when it comes to gaining new gear and leveling up quickly.

#  New FFXIV Players In Peru Can Now Use The Leveling System To Gain A Head Start

Square Enix has announced that they will now be providing the leveling system for new players in Peru. This news was released on the official website and is available in Spanish.

The leveling system is a great way for new players to catch up with the game more quickly. The system will provide players with experience bonuses for completing content related to their level, allowing them to reach level 50 much faster than someone who does not use the system.

This perk is especially beneficial for new FF14 players in Peru because of how many levels are required to reach endgame content. Reaching level 50 is an important milestone for any player, and this addition makes it much easier for newcomers to get there.

For those who have never played Final Fantasy XIV before, it is important to understand some of the basics of the game before jumping in. One of the most important aspects of the game is character progression, which can be divided into three categories: general experience (or exp), class experience (or “x”), and discipline experience (or “y”). Players can obtain exp by completing quests, fighting monsters, gathering resources, and so on; while “x” and “y” can only be gained by doing specific things related to that class or discipline. This can make progressing through the game a bit more difficult than simply gaining levels via general exp.

FFXIV also has a Job System which allows players to specialize their characters in different ways after reaching level 30. Players start off with two jobs and can unlock more as they progress through the game. Each job has its own set of abilities that can be used in battle, as well as a unique equip loadout. It is important for players to choose wisely when selecting their jobs because they will be stuck with them until they reach level 50. At that point, they will then select their final job and gain access to all of its abilities.

Players should also be aware that there are four roles in FFXIV: tank, healer, damage dealer (DPS), and regulator (limited use support). These roles determine what kind of party composition is best suited for taking on various tasks throughout Eorzea (the game world). Tanks are meant to take damage and hold enemies’ attention while the other party members deal damage; healers keep everyone alive by curing them and restoring their HP; DPS specialize in dealing large amounts of damage very quickly; and regulators help out by using skills that buff allies or debuff enemies. It is important for all players to know what each role does so they can make informed decisions about party composition when setting out on a quest.
