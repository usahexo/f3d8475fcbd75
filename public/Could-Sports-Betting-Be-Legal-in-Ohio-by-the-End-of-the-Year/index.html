      		<h1 id="Could-Sports-Betting-Be-Legal-in-Ohio-by-the-End-of-the-Year"><a href="#Could-Sports-Betting-Be-Legal-in-Ohio-by-the-End-of-the-Year" class="headerlink" title="Could Sports Betting Be Legal in Ohio by the End of the Year?"></a>Could Sports Betting Be Legal in Ohio by the End of the Year?</h1><p>The Buckeye state could be one step closer to legalizing sports betting before the end of 2018.</p>
<p>According to The Cincinnati Enquirer, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Ohio statehouse have proposed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>The goal is to have legislation in place before the start of the NFL season in September.</p>
<p>“I think it has a really good chance of passing,” Rep. Mike Duffey, a Republican from Worthington and one of the bill’s sponsors, told The Enquirer.</p>
<p>If passed, the law would allow Ohioans to bet on professional and college sports at casinos and racetracks within the state. It would also allow for mobile betting platforms.</p>
<p>While some Ohio lawmakers are in support of legalizing sports betting, there is still opposition to the idea. One concern is that legalizing sports betting will lead to more gambling addiction problems.</p>
<p>Duffey acknowledged that there are risks associated with gambling but he believes they can be managed.</p>
<p>“There’s always been risk with gambling, but we have a lot of laws on the books already to deal with those risks,” he said. “This just provides an opportunity forOhioans to participate in what already occurs illegally anyway.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not the bill will pass, but if it does, Ohio would join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Legislative-Efforts-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Ohio-Gain-Momentum"><a href="#Legislative-Efforts-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Ohio-Gain-Momentum" class="headerlink" title="Legislative Efforts to Legalize Sports Betting in Ohio Gain Momentum"></a>Legislative Efforts to Legalize Sports Betting in Ohio Gain Momentum</h1><p>A little more than a week ago, the Ohio Senate passed SB 316, also known as the “Ohio Sports Betting Act” with bipartisan support. The bill would legalize sports betting in the state of Ohio, following the footsteps of other states who have recently legalized sports betting such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The passage of SB 316 is seen as a victory by many in the state, especially those in the gambling industry who have been pushing for the legalization of sports betting for years. Gambling advocates argue that legalizing sports betting would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Those in opposition to legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to an increase in problem gambling, and that it could also be used by criminals and corrupt organizations to launder money.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, momentum is growing for the legalization of sports betting in Ohio. In addition to the passage of SB 316 in the Senate,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> there is also bi-partisan support for a bill that would legalize and regulate sports betting in Ohio pending before the Ohio House of Representatives.</p>
<p>If both bills are passed and signed into law, Ohio would become the fifth state to legalize sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last year.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Could-Soon-be-Legal-in-Ohio"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Could-Soon-be-Legal-in-Ohio" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Could Soon be Legal in Ohio"></a>Sports Betting Could Soon be Legal in Ohio</h1><p>Sports betting could soon be legal in Ohio, as lawmakers look to legalize the activity in order to bring in new revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are expected to introduce a bill this week that would allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. The bill would also allow for mobile betting, which would give residents the ability to place bets on their smartphones or other devices.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how much revenue the state could generate from sports betting, but lawmakers are hoping that it will help to offset some of the state’s budget shortfall. In addition, they believe that it could create new jobs in the casino and racing industries.</p>
<p>Ohio is one of several states that is considering legalizing sports betting, as more and more people are wagering on sports online. In fact, according to a survey by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, 11 percent of Americans have placed a bet on a sporting event in the last year. That number is expected to grow as more states legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>If Ohio does move forward with legalization, it will join a number of other states, including Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia, that have already legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Ohio-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Ohio-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Ohio Poised to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>Ohio Poised to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>In a major victory for the gambling industry, the Ohio state legislature has approved a bill that legalizes sports betting.</p>
<p>The bill, which was passed by the state Senate on November 26, will now be sent to Governor Mike DeWine for his signature. If he signs it into law, Ohio will become the fifth state to legalize sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the activity in 2018.</p>
<p>Under the proposed law, Ohioans will be able to place bets on sporting events through land-based casinos, online platforms, and mobile apps. The minimum age for gambling will be 21, and bets can only be placed on professional and college sports.</p>
<p>Casinos and other gambling operators in Ohio are already gearing up for legalization. In Columbus, for example, Hollywood Casino has announced plans to open a sportsbook at its facility. And in Cleveland, Jack Entertainment—which owns JACK Cleveland Casino and JACK Thistledown Racino—has said it intends to offer sports betting at both locations.</p>
<p>Ohio is not alone in moving to legalize sports betting in recent months. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, lawmakers in at least 25 states have considered bills that would allow some form of sports gambling this year.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it will generate revenue for states and create jobs. They also say that it will help keep people engaged in legal gambling activities rather than turning to black market operators.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalization argue that it could lead to addiction and social problems. They also note that there is no guarantee that states will see significant revenue from sports betting operations.</p>
<h1 id="Ohio-Moves-Closer-to-Legalizing-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Ohio-Moves-Closer-to-Legalizing-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Ohio Moves Closer to Legalizing Sports Betting"></a>Ohio Moves Closer to Legalizing Sports Betting</h1><p>On Tuesday, November 13th, the Ohio House of Representatives passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The vote was bipartisan, with 69 Republicans and 11 Democrats voting in favor of the legislation. The bill now moves to the Senate for further consideration.</p>
<p>If ultimately passed and signed into law, Ohio would become the fifth state to allow sports betting, joining New Jersey, West Virginia, Nevada and Delaware. In order to place a bet, individuals would have to be at least 21 years old and physically present in a casino or racetrack.</p>
<p>Governor John Kasich has not taken a public position on the bill but is generally supportive of gambling expansion in Ohio. In 2012 he vetoed a bill that would have authorized video slot machines at Ohio’s seven horse racing tracks. However, he subsequently approved a measure that allowed for the construction of four casinos in the state.</p>
<p>The NFL, NBA, MLB and NCAA all oppose legalized sports betting on the grounds that it could lead to game-fixing and other forms of cheating. However, proponents argue that it would generate tax revenue for states and create jobs. They also maintain that current laws prohibiting sports betting are unconstitutional because they infringe on states’ rights to regulate gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that Americans illegally bet over $150 billion on sports each year. If legalized and regulated, the AGA believes that sports betting could generate up to $8 billion annually in tax revenue for states.</p>
