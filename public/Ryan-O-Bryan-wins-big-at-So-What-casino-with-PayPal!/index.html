<h1 id="So-What-casino-leads-the-way-with-new-payment-method"><a href="#So-What-casino-leads-the-way-with-new-payment-method" class="headerlink" title="So What casino leads the way with new payment method!"></a>So What casino leads the way with new payment method!</h1><p>Casino is now one of the first to offer a brand new payment method that is shaking up the industry. The company has announced that it will start accepting Bitcoin, the leading digital currency, as a payment option. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular as it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It is also a very secure form of payment as every transaction is recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain. This makes it difficult for criminals to use Bitcoin for illegal activities. </p>
<p>Bitcoin can be used to purchase goods and services online and can also be converted into traditional currency. Casino CEO, Matti Sarvamaa, said: “We are always looking for new and innovative ways to offer our players the best possible gaming experience.” </p>
<p>“The decision to start accepting Bitcoin was made after careful consideration and we believe that it will be beneficial for both our players and our company.” </p>
<p>Other casinos are expected to follow suit and begin accepting Bitcoin in the near future.</p>

The lucky winner took home over $1.2 million dollars in prize money, and celebrated his good fortune by hitting the town with his buddies.</p>
<p>“It was an incredible feeling,” said Ryan of his big win. “I still can’t believe it happened.”</p>
<p>Ryan and his friends had a great time celebrating at some of the city’s hottest clubs and casinos. But for Ryan, the best part of it all was knowing that he’d won such a huge amount of money.</p>
<p>“This is going to change my life,” he said. “I’m so excited to start spending it.”</p>
<p>Ryan is already talking about using his windfall to buy a new car and taking a trip to Europe. And who knows - maybe he’ll even be able to retire early!</p>
<p>No one could be happier for Ryan than his friends and family. His mother was especially thrilled, calling him her “millionaire son” in interviews with the press.</p>
<p>“I’m just overjoyed that my boy won big,” she said. “He’s always been a good kid, and now he’s got something to show for it.”</p>
<p>Ryan’s friends were no less excited for him, cheering him on as he hit the jackpot. They were all eager to share in his good fortune and enjoy some of the spoils of victory.</p>
<p>“This is amazing,” said one friend as they partied at a club in Vegas. “I can’t believe we’re celebrating Ryan’s big win!”</p>
