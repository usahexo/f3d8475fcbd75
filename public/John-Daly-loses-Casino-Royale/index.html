      		<h1 id="John-Daly-loses-Casino-Royale"><a href="#John-Daly-loses-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="John Daly loses Casino Royale"></a>John Daly loses Casino Royale</h1><p>Heavyweight John Daly lost a high-stakes poker game against Hollywood superstar Daniel Craig, during which Craig won $1 million. The game was played at the Casino Royale in New York City.</p>
<p>The two had been playing for hours when Craig finally won the hand, sending Daly home a loser. “John didn’t seem too happy about it,” said eyewitnesses.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Daly has lost big money gambling; he is well known for his proclivity to take risks with his finances. In fact, in 2010 he filed for bankruptcy after losing millions of dollars at casinos.</p>
<p>Despite his losses, Daly still enjoys playing poker, and plans to continue competing in tournaments around the world.</p>
<h1 id="Daly-down-1-5-million-in-Casino-Royale"><a href="#Daly-down-1-5-million-in-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Daly down $1.5 million in Casino Royale"></a>Daly down $1.5 million in Casino Royale</h1><p>On Saturday night, November 12th, 2016, professional poker player and two-time World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet winner John Daley (better known as “JohnDoe”) went on an epic downswing at the world-famous Casino Royale in Las Vegas, losing a total of $1.5 million in just six hours of play.</p>
<p>The first signs that things were not going well for Doe came shortly after midnight when he lost a large pot to his friend and fellow professional poker player Alex Foxen. Then, in what would prove to be the beginning of a disastrous run, Doe lost back-to-back hands against Craig Varnell – totaling over $600,000 – to slip well into the red.</p>
<p>Things went from bad to worse for Doe as he continued to clash with some of the top players at the table. In one particularly unlucky hand, Doe shoved all-in with ace-king only to run into Jason Koon’s pocket aces. The river brought yet another king, giving Koon Quad Aces and sending Doe packing with nothing but a few angry words for his vanquished opponent.</p>
<p>By 7:00am Sunday morning, Doe’s bankroll had been reduced to just $300,000 and it was clear that he was going to have to go on a heater if he wanted to avoid finishing the weekend in the red. Unfortunately for Doe, that is not what happened. In fact, things only got worse for him as he proceeded to lose another $500,000 before finally booking his exit from Casino Royale just after 11:00am Sunday morning.</p>
<p>So how does a professional poker player go so badly wrong in such a short amount of time? According to experts like poker pro Mason Malmuth, much of it has to do with Lady Luck refusing to smile on John Daley during this particular session at the casino. “It’s simply not realistic to expect any player – no matter how skilled – to win money every single time they sit down at a table,” said Malmuth in an interview with PokerNews earlier today. “Occasionally even the best players are going to endure long stretches where they can’t seem to win no matter what they do.”</p>
<p>However, while luck may have played its part in Daley’s downfall this weekend, Malmuth believes that the main reason for Doe’s losses was due simply to him playing too many hands and making poor decisions as a result. “When you’re playing high stakes poker against some of the best players in the world,” said Malmuth,”the margins for error are razor thin and if you make even one mistake it can cost you dearly.”</p>
<h1 id="How-much-has-John-Daly-lost-in-Casino-Royale"><a href="#How-much-has-John-Daly-lost-in-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="How much has John Daly lost in Casino Royale?"></a>How much has John Daly lost in Casino Royale?</h1><p>John Daly is a professional golfer who has been involved in some high-stakes gambling over the years. In 2006, he made headlines when he lost $1.5 million in one night at the Casino Royale in Las Vegas. So, how much has John Daly lost overall in his casino visits?</p>
<p>In total, John Daly has reportedly lost over $7 million in casino visits. This includes his losses at the Casino Royale in 2006, as well as other casinos across the country. This amount of money could have gone a long way for Daly, who has had financial struggles over the years.</p>
<p>Luckily for Daly, he was able to make a comeback on the golf course in 2007 and earn over $2 million that year. He also won the PGA Championship in 1991 and is considered one of the greatest golfers of all time. However, his losses at the casino will always be a part of his legacy.</p>
<h1 id="John-Daly-A-big-loser-in-Casino-Royale"><a href="#John-Daly-A-big-loser-in-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="John Daly: A big loser in Casino Royale"></a>John Daly: A big loser in Casino Royale</h1><p>Mention of John Daly in the context of the James Bond film “Casino Royale” usually elicits giggles. As an unprofessional, overweight and arguably drunk gambler, Daly was the diametric opposite of 007 and his suave and sophisticated demeanor. But a closer look at Daly’s role in the movie reveals that he was actually a big loser - not just in the casino, but also within the film itself.</p>
<p>The character of John Daly is introduced early on in “Casino Royale” as a gambler who has had several run-ins with casino security. He is first seen being escorted out of the building by two burly guards, after which he proceeds to berate them for being “losers”. It soon becomes clear that this is a man with a lot of anger and resentment towards the world, and it’s this anger that eventually leads to his downfall.</p>
<p>Later in the movie, we see Daly making a desperate last stand at the blackjack table. He’s down to his last few chips and he’s clearly not going to walk away a winner. In fact, he ends up losing all his money - and then some. Not only does Daly lose at the casino, but he’s also humiliated by Bond himself, who easily beats him at cards.</p>
<p>In the end, Daly is shown being led away by security once again, this time with his tail between his legs. He may have provided some comic relief in “Casino Royale”, but overall he was nothing more than a big loser.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Royale-losses-cost-John-Daly-1-million"><a href="#Casino-Royale-losses-cost-John-Daly-1-million" class="headerlink" title="Casino Royale losses cost John Daly $1 million"></a>Casino Royale losses cost John Daly $1 million</h1><p>In 2010, professional golfer John Daly admitted that he lost around $1 million playing casino royale games between 2004 and 2010. This revelation came about as a result of legal troubles Daly faced when he was caught trying to bring nearly $300,000 worth of chips from a casino in Nevada back to his home state of Arkansas.</p>
<p>Daly claimed that most of the money he lost was spent on blackjack and craps, but it’s not known how much he may have won during that same timeframe. What is known, however, is that casino royale losses can be extremely costly - both financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>For many people, the allure of casino royale games is simply too strong to resist. And while there’s no denying that casinos can be fun places to visit, they’re also notoriously dangerous when it comes to losing money. In fact, statistics show that the average casino gambler loses anywhere from two to three percent of their total bankroll each time they visit a casino.</p>
<p>That might not seem like a lot, but over time it can add up quickly. For example, if you start with a $1,000 bankroll and lose two percent per visit, you’ll be down by $200 after just 10 visits. And if you keep going at that rate, you’ll eventually lose your entire bankroll - no matter how large it may be.</p>
<p>What’s more, even if you don’t end up losing all your money at the casino, there’s a good chance you’ll still experience negative emotions like stress, frustration, and disappointment. This is because casino royale games are designed to give players an edge over the house. And as anyone who’s ever played these games knows, it’s virtually impossible to win in the long run.</p>
<p>So if you’re thinking about visiting a casino anytime soon, remember this: chances are good that you’ll wind up losing money in the long run - no matter how good of a player you think you are. So before you head to the casino, make sure you have enough money set aside for entertainment purposes only - and nothing else.</p>
